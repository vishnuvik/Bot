# Bot
A mathematical bot is a type of computer program that is designed to perform mathematical calculations automatically.
# Mathematical Bot
Mathematical Bot is a Python-based computer program that can perform simple mathematical calculations automatically, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

# Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

# Prerequisites
To run this bot, you need to have Python 3.6 or higher installed on your machine.

# Usage
To use the bot, simply run the math_bot.py script in a Python environment. You will be prompted to enter two numbers and an operator (+, -, *, or /). The bot will then perform the requested operation and display the result.

# Steps to run RASA bot

* Activate the virtual environment: If you are using a virtual environment, activate it by running the command source <virtual_environment>/bin/activate.

* Train the model: Train the Rasa model by running the command rasa train. This will train the model using the training data and configuration files in your project directory.

* Start the action server: Start the action server by running the command rasa run actions. This will start the server that handles custom actions in your bot.

* Start the bot: Start the Rasa bot by running the command rasa run. This will start the bot in the command line interface (CLI) mode.

* Interact with the bot: Interact with the bot by typing messages in the CLI. The bot will respond based on the NLU model and dialogue management rules that you have defined.

# Note:You may also want to run the rasa shell command to interact with the bot in an interactive shell environment with a more user-friendly interface.
